        <h2>Method</h2>
        <h3>Roti</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour and salt together.</li>
            <li>Rub in ghee or oil and add water all at once and combine to a soft dough.</li>
            <li>Knead dough for about 10 mins until soft, smooth, and elastic. Depending on the flour, you may deed to add less, the 'flour' will tell you!</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 10 equal balls and place them in a bowl with enough oil to cover.</li>
            <li>Rest for atleast 1 hour.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tblspns ghee in a frying pan.</li>
            <li>Fry ginger and diced onion until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add all the spices except the garam masala and fry for a few minutes</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and celeery.</li>
            <li>Now add the sliced onion and cook adding a bit of oil if it gets too dry.</li>
            <li>Add meat and salt and stir until the meat changes colour, breaking up the lumps of meat.</li>
            <li>Add the garam masala and continue to cook, stirring until all the meat is brown, caramelised.</li>
            <li>Add water and cover.</li>
            <li>When the meat is cooked, add green chilli slices.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat and simmer until mixture appears dry (the moisture has cooked out).</li>
            <li>Allow to cool. Add peas and coriander.</li>
            <li>Season to taste.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre heat a griddle pan.</li>
            <li>Take the balls out of the oil and grease down the flat surface with the oil, then roll out as thin as filo pastry, not worrying if you get a few holes. You just need the middle section with out holes.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease the pan and carefully drape the dough over the rolling pin and place it on the hot griddle.</li>
            <li>Working quickly as the dough is very fine and will cook quickly, spoon on beaten egg and spread over the centre with the back of a spoon.</li>
            <li>Spoon over some of the meat mix and sliced onion.</li>
            <li>Fold over all the edges and enclose the filling like an envelope.</li>
            <li>Turn it over to cook the other side, brushing the pan with oil or ghee as you go.</li>
            <li>Keep frying and turning until both sides are crispy and golden in colour.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with cirry, pickled onions or just as is.</li>
        </ol>
