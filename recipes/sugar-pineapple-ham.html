        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 fully cooded, bone-in ham</li>
            <li>1 fresh pineapple</li>
            <li>2 cans of pineapple juice</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place ham, cut-side down, into a roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Cut skin off pineapple with a sharp knife and slice off any brown spots or skin left behind. Cut pineapple into 1/2-inch-thick rings and use a round cutter to remove cores. Pin rings onto ham with toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Bake ham in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While ham bakes, mix pineapple juice and brown sugar in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on medium power until glaze is boiling and slightly thickened. Work carefully because glaze will be sticky and very hot.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/2 of the glaze evenly over ham and pineapple rings. Bake ham for 30 minutes more, then pour remaining glaze over ham.</li>
            <li> Continue baking ham until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of ham reads 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), 30 to 60 minutes more.</li>
        </ol>
